Physical examination discloses periorbital edema but no jugular venous distention. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination discloses an S1 and S2 without murmurs or gallops. Abdominal examination discloses bulging flanks and shifting dullness to percussion. Examination of the lower extremities shows pitting edema from the mid thigh to the ankles bilaterally.

Study participants include 140 women (70%) and 60 men (30%) ages 30 to 60 years, with baseline blood pressure measurements of 150/95 mm Hg or higher. The investigators defined antihypertensive therapy as effective if the treatment resulted in a blood pressure measurement below 140/90 mm Hg. When designing the study, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%; they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%. Which of the following is the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study?\n(J) 1% (K) 10% (L) 40% (M) 90% [/INST] The answer to the question is the option (M) 90%",

She tells you that she has not had a menstrual period for the past 6 months. She is a college student who is in good health, has not had any medical illnesses or surgery, and has never been pregnant. She is currently sexually active and uses barrier contraception. She reports that during the past year her menses had become very irregular prior to complete cessation 6 months ago. She also notes that she has gained about 9 kg (20 lb) in the past 6 months and has had an increasing problem with acne and a troublesome growth of hair on her thighs and abdomen. She has been somewhat depressed about this, and her grades have declined. She reports that one of her sisters also had this problem prior to getting married. Physical examination shows a mildly obese young woman who has scattered facial acne, mild male pattern hair growth on the abdomen, and an essentially normal pelvic examination except for slight enlargement of the uterus and both ovaries. This patient's history is most consistent with which of the following?\n(J) Androgen-producing ovarian tumor (K) Cushing syndrome (L) Hypothyroidism (M) Polycystic ovarian syndrome [/INST] The answer to the question is the option (K) Cushing syndrome",
