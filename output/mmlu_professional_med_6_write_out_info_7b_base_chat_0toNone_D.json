She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled β-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 44 years and drinks one alcoholic beverage daily. She appears thin. Examination shows a 2-cm, nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area. Examination shows no other abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows a large right lower lobe density. A CT scan of the chest shows a 7.5 x 7.5 x 6-cm right lower lobe mass with some scattered calcifications. The lesion abuts the posterior chest wall without clear invasion. There are right lower peritracheal, precarinal, right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes.

Her parents say that she started walking at the age of 14 months and since then has always seemed clumsier and had more injuries than other children. She has had increasingly frequent chest pain with exertion since starting a soccer program 3 months ago. She usually has pain or swelling of her knees or ankles after practice. She has been wearing glasses for 2 years. Her 16-year-old brother has required two operations for a severe rotator cuff injury he sustained while taking a shower, and she has a maternal cousin who died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 26 years. Today, the patient walks with a limp. She is at the 99th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. A midsystolic click is heard at the apex. The left ankle is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. The joints of the upper and lower extremities are hypermobile, including 25 degrees of genu recurvatum, thumbs that may be extended to touch the forearms, and flexibility at the waist, with palms easily touching the floor with straight knees.

Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 129/79 mm Hg. Examination of the right knee shows warmth, erythema, and effusion. Exquisite tenderness is produced with minimal range-of-motion testing. Examination of synovial fluid obtained via joint aspiration shows that it is clear, with positively birefringent rhomboids observed under polarized light microscopy. Deposition of which of the following substances is the most likely cause of these findings?\n(A) Ammonium urate (B) Calcium oxalate (C) Calcium urate (D) Calcium pyrophosphate\nAnswer: [/INST] (C) Calcium urate",
