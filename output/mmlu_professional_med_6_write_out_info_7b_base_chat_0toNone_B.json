Medical history is significant for an abnormal Pap smear in her 20s; her most recent Pap smear was done 12 years ago during her second pregnancy, and she recalls the results as being normal. She takes no medications. The patient was married for 18 years; her husband died 4 years ago and had undergone vasectomy after the birth of their last child. The patient has not had any new sexual partners since her husband's death. BMI is 32 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse 90/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 155/96 mm Hg. Speculum examination discloses normal vaginal mucosa. The cervix is friable with a 1-cm exophytic mass lateral to the cervical os at the nine o'clock position.

Her parents say that she started walking at the age of 14 months and since then has always seemed clumsier and had more injuries than other children. She has had increasingly frequent chest pain with exertion since starting a soccer program 3 months ago. She usually has pain or swelling of her knees or ankles after practice. She has been wearing glasses for 2 years. Her 16-year-old brother has required two operations for a severe rotator cuff injury he sustained while taking a shower, and she has a maternal cousin who died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 26 years. Today, the patient walks with a limp. She is at the 99th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. A midsystolic click is heard at the apex. The left ankle is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain.

He says that he has been noncompliant with his diabetic regimen, adding, \"Sometimes I forget.\" He has been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them but admits that he is lonely. He did not get out of bed for 2 days, which prompted his wife to call an ambulance and have him admitted to the hospital. Prior to admission to the hospital, his only medication was insulin, although he often missed doses. He does not drink alcohol. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 36 kg/m2 . His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he is tired and has a restricted affect. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Cognition is intact. His fasting serum glucose concentration is 120 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n(A) Adhere to the patient's wishes on the condition that he agree to home nursing care (B) Adhere to the patient's wishes and discuss home-care options (C) Schedule neuropsychological testing (D) Seek a court order to appoint a legal guardian\nAnswer: [/INST] (B) Adhere to the patient's wishes and discuss home-care options",
