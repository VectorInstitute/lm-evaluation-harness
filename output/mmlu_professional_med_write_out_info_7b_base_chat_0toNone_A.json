Output a single option from the four options as the final answer.\n\nQuestion: A 64-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 5-month history of increasing shortness of breath, sore throat, and a cough productive of a small amount of white phlegm. Over the past week, she has had nausea related to excess coughing. Over the past year, she has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss. She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled β-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 44 years and drinks one alcoholic beverage daily. She appears thin. Examination shows a 2-cm, nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area. Examination shows no other abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows a large right lower lobe density. A CT scan of the chest shows a 7.5 x 7.5 x 6-cm right lower lobe mass with some scattered calcifications. The lesion abuts the posterior chest wall without clear invasion. There are right lower peritracheal, precarinal, right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes. There is a 1.5-cm mass in the right adrenal gland. A biopsy specimen of the lung mass is most likely to show which of the following?\n(A) Non-small cell lung carcinoma (B) Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast (C) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (D) Mesothelioma\nAnswer: [/INST] (D)",

She says her heart is \"racing\" and she is coughing up a small amount of bloodstreaked sputum. Medical history is significant for hypothyroidism, for which she takes levothyroxine. An intravenous catheter is placed. Vital signs are temperature 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse 132/min, respirations 32/min, and blood pressure 135/78 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on 100% oxygen via nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Auscultation of the lungs discloses decreased breath sounds at the bases with expiratory crackles bilaterally. Cardiac examination discloses an irregularly irregular rhythm, an indistinct point of maximal impulse, and a loud S1.

The tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed. During the past month the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent. She is now embarrassed to eat with other people because of how obvious the tremor has become. The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks to help her to cope with the death of her husband 2 months ago. Medical history is also remarkable for essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin. Her only other medication is occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily because, she says, it reduces her tremor. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (155 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse 80/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a moderate tremor of both hands that is not present at rest. Complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and serum thyroid function tests are ordered and results are pending.

Physical examination discloses periorbital edema but no jugular venous distention. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination discloses an S1 and S2 without murmurs or gallops. Abdominal examination discloses bulging flanks and shifting dullness to percussion. Examination of the lower extremities shows pitting edema from the mid thigh to the ankles bilaterally.

The babysitter reports that she is 15 years old and has cared for the patient on numerous occasions during the past year. The child's mother, who is a single parent, is currently out of town for business but will return later tonight.

The child looks tired and sits upright on the babysitter's lap. He is obviously comfortable with his caregiver. Vital signs are temperature 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 28/min and labored, and blood pressure 85/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. Physical examination discloses inspiratory stridor. Neck is supple, tympanic membranes are normal, and there is a profuse nasal discharge. Examination of the pharynx discloses no abnormalities. Auscultation of the chest discloses equal air entry on both sides and no crackles. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Treatment with 40% oxygen via venturi mask and intravenous fluids is initiated. Despite continued supplemental oxygen and hydration, the child remains tachypneic and stridorous at rest. Oxygen saturation is now 93%.

Solve it in a step-by-step fashion, starting by summarizing the available information from the abstract. Output a single option from the four options as the final answer.\n\nQuestion: A 35-year-old man with spina bifida is admitted to the hospital for a urologic procedure. He has been functionally independent in activities of daily living and is employed doing inventory control in a local sporting goods store. He has maintained continence through periodic self-catheterization. The patient is paraplegic, has recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stones, and recent onset of incontinence secondary to detrusor and bladder neck dysfunction. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows a well-developed, well-nourished man in no acute distress. Aside from paraplegia, lower extremity muscle atrophy, and lower abdominal surgical scars, the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. He had an episode of anaphylaxis secondary to latex allergy during a previous operation for functional expansion of his bladder through a bowel anastomosis. Which of the following is most important to consider in the care of this patient?\n(A) Use of rubber urethral catheters (B) Preparation of food by outside contractors (C) Type of cleaning agents used to sterilize bed linens (D) Administration of injectable medications with disposable syringes\nAnswer: [/INST] (A)",
