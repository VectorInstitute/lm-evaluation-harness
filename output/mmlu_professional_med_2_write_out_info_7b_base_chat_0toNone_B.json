The patient reports no new symptoms except for shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise that began 3 months ago when he tried to increase the distance of his daily walk from 1 mile to 3 miles. He has not had orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest pain. Additional medical history is significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, and polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient also has a heart murmur that was discovered at an armed forces screening physical examination at age 18 years, but it did not prevent him from serving in the military. Medications are metoprolol, atorvastatin, lisinopril, omeprazole, and a low dose of prednisone every other day. The patient is active and manages a small farm. BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse 60/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 124/61 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a normal S1, pronounced S2, and a grade 2/6 late systolic murmur heard at the right upper parasternal border. Pulses are normal in contour. Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n(A) Decrease the dose of metoprolol (B) Order a transthoracic echocardiography (C) Obtain serum vitamin D concentration (D) Increase the dose of prednisone\nThe answer to the question is [/INST](D) Increase the dose of prednisone",

She says that her medical condition has declined so much that she no longer wishes to go on living; she is nearly blind and will likely require bilateral leg amputations. She reports that she has always been an active person and does not see how her life will be of value anymore. She has no family and most of her friends are sick or deceased. On mental status examination, she is alert and cooperative. She accurately describes her medical history and understands the consequences of refusing insulin. There is no evidence of depression. She dismisses any attempts by the physician to change her mind, saying that the physician is too young to understand her situation.

Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities.
