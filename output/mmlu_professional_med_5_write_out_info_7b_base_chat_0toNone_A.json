Over the past week, she has had nausea related to excess coughing. Over the past year, she has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss. She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled β-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 44 years and drinks one alcoholic beverage daily. She appears thin. Examination shows a 2-cm, nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area. Examination shows no other abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows a large right lower lobe density. A CT scan of the chest shows a 7.5 x 7.5 x 6-cm right lower lobe mass with some scattered calcifications. The lesion abuts the posterior chest wall without clear invasion. There are right lower peritracheal, precarinal, right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes. There is a 1.5-cm mass in the right adrenal gland. A biopsy specimen of the lung mass is most likely to show which of the following?\n(A) Non-small cell lung carcinoma (B) Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast (C) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (D) Mesothelioma [/INST] Answer: (A) Non-small cell lung carcinoma",

Medical history is significant for an abnormal Pap smear in her 20s; her most recent Pap smear was done 12 years ago during her second pregnancy, and she recalls the results as being normal. She takes no medications. The patient was married for 18 years; her husband died 4 years ago and had undergone vasectomy after the birth of their last child. The patient has not had any new sexual partners since her husband's death. BMI is 32 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse 90/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 155/96 mm Hg. Speculum examination discloses normal vaginal mucosa. The cervix is friable with a 1-cm exophytic mass lateral to the cervical os at the nine o'clock position. Which of the following is the most critical factor in formulating a management plan for this patient?\n(A) Stage of disease (B) Obesity (C) Patient age (D) Hypertension [/INST] Answer: (B) Obesity",

The patient's daughter, who is visiting the patient, says he has had increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation during the past 6 months. She also says that there are times during the day when his tremors increase in severity, although he continues to care for himself at home. Medical history is also remarkable for hypertension. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 78 kg (172 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.9°C (102.0°F), pulse 60/min supine and 68/min standing, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg supine and 80/50 mm Hg standing. The patient appears ill and older than his stated age. He is fully oriented but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung field. Abdominal examination discloses no abnormalities. Neurologic examination discloses masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity; gait was not assessed on admission. Chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. ECG shows no abnormalities. Appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated. Prior to discharge, which of the following is the most appropriate step?\n(A) Obtain a swallowing evaluation (B) Obtain CT scan of the chest (C) Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube (D) Prescribe fludrocortisone [/INST] Answer: (B) Obtain CT scan of the chest",

The child looks tired and sits upright on the babysitter's lap. He is obviously comfortable with his caregiver. Vital signs are temperature 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 28/min and labored, and blood pressure 85/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. Physical examination discloses inspiratory stridor. Neck is supple, tympanic membranes are normal, and there is a profuse nasal discharge. Examination of the pharynx discloses no abnormalities.

Solve it in a step-by-step fashion, starting by summarizing the available information from the abstract. Output a single option from the four options as the final answer.\n\nQuestion: A 27-year-old man is admitted to the hospital 45 minutes after being involved in a motor vehicle collision. Physical examination shows a sluggish response to stimuli. Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities. A skull x-ray shows a linear, nondepressed basal skull fracture. Two weeks later, the patient develops polyuria and polydipsia. Laboratory studies show a serum glucose concentration within the reference range, increased serum osmolality, and decreased urine osmolality. Following the administration of desmopressin, urine osmolality increases. The beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to activation of which of the following?\n(A) Adenylyl cyclase (B) Ca2+ channels (C) Janus kinase (D) Serine kinase [/INST] Answer: (A) Adenylyl cyclase",
