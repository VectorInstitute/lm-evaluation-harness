Output a single option from the four options as the final answer.\n\nQuestion: A recent theory concerning an unusual rise in asthma attacks following a thunderstorm proposes that while pollen grains at 5 microns are too large to enter the airways, their exposure to water precipitates the release of starch granules as a result of osmotic shock. The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack. If this theory is true, which of the following is a correct statement?\n(J) The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment. (K) The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment. (L) The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents. (M) The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents. [/INST] The answer to the question is the option (M) The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.",
