The genes that allow the host bird species to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings to the detriment of their own offspring most likely remain in the gene pool of the population because\n(A) on average, the host birds' response allows them to rear their own young efficiently by feeding only those who indicate they are hungry (B) the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species (C) on average, little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own (D) the maximum fitness of the cuckoo would then be reduced [/INST] Answer: (D) the maximum fitness of the cuckoo would then be reduced",
